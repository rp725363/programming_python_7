Q1. Write a Python Program to find sum of array?
Ans:-
Here we have written function below to find the sum of array as below.
def arrey_sum(arr):
    sum=0
    for num in arr:
        sum += num
    return sum


arrey=input("enter your element of arreys (space_saparated): ").split()
arrey=[int(num) for num in arrey]
result=arrey_sum(arrey)
print(f"the sum of the arrey is {result}")
# for example if the user enters 1 2 3 4 5, the program will calculate the sum as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 and display the result as The sum of the array is: 15.

Q2. Write a Python Program to find largest element in an array?
Ans:-
here we have written function to find the largest element in the array as below
def find_largest_array(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return None
    largest=arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > largest:
            largest=num
    return largest
array=input("enter your element of arreys (space_saparated): ").split()
array=[int(num) for num in array]
largest_array=find_largest_array(array)


if largest_array is None:
    print("the array is empty")
else:
    print(f"the largest element in the array is {largest_array}")

# If the user enters 12 45 3 27 8, the program will find the largest element as 45 and display the result as The largest element in the array is: 45


Q3.  Write a Python Program for array rotation?
Ans:-
Here we have written functio below to rotate array as below.

def rotate_array(arr,k):
    n=len(arr)
    k%=n   #to normalize the k if it is large than n.
    rotated_array=array[k:]+array[:k]
    return rotated_array

array=input("enter the element of the array(space_saparated): ").split()
array=[int(num) for num in array]

k=int(input("enter the number of rotation"))

rotated_array=rotate_array(array,k)
print(f"rotated array {rotated_array}")
# if the user enters 1 2 3 4 5 as the array and 2 as the number of rotations, the program will perform the rotation and display the result as Array after rotation: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Q4. Write a Python Program to Split the array and add the first part to the end?
Ans:-
Here we have written below function to split and add function to split a array and add it to end as below.

def split_and_add(arr,k):
    n=len(arr)
    k%=n      # to normalize the k if large than n
    split_arr=arr[k:]+arr[:k]
    return split_arr

array=input("enter the element of array (space_saparated): ").split()
array=[int(num) for num in array]

k=int(input("enter the number of element to split"))

result_array=split_and_add(array,k)
print(f"this is splited and added array {result_array}")

# f the user enters 1 2 3 4 5 as the array and 2 as the number of elements to split, the program will perform the operation and display the result as Array after splitting and adding: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Q5. Write a Python Program to check if given array is Monotonic?
Ans:-
here we have written function to read and identify the array if it is monotonic array or not.
def is_monotonis(arr):
    increasing=decreasing=True
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i]<arr[i-1]:
            increasing=False
        if arr[i] > arr[i-1]:
            decreasing=False
    return increasing or decreasing
array=input("enter your element of array(space_saparated)").split()
array=[int(num) for num in array]

result=is_monotonis(array)

if result:
    print("this is monotonic array")
else:
    print("this is not monotonic array")
    
#if the user enters 1 2 3 4 5 as the array, the program will determine that the array is monotonic and display the result as The array is monotonic.
